# Rhythm

Rhythm is an android music player, it is a side project to follow up a design that I found  on MaterialUp, Credits to [Alexandr Demidov](https://dribbble.com/yyann) and his wonderful [design](http://www.materialup.com/posts/music-app-research).

3rd Party Libraries I used in the app so far :
*   [Realm.io](https://realm.io/)
*   [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView)
*   [mp3agic](https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic)


It is still in progress! there is alot of of work to do!
